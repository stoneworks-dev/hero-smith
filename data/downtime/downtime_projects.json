You and any creatures you designate can operate the ship by touching the ship's wheel. During combat, a creature touching the wheel can maneuver to make the ship move up to 10 squares. The ship can be moved only once per round. Out of combat, the ship has a speed of 130 miles per day.\n\nAn airship is an object (giving it damage immunity all to poison and psychic damage) and can take 200 damage before it is destroyed.
