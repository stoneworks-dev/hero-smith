      "effect_description": "Whether drawn from a stone, gifted by a lake spirit, forged by a god, or used to kill one, there is a sword that exists outside of time and space. It is always where it needs to be precisely when it needs to be there—then is gone in a flash when the need for it has waned.\n\nSuited for Victory: This sword takes on the size, shape, and make that the wielder wills into it. It can be a light, medium, or heavy weapon, and you can change its weapon type and appearance as a free maneuver once per turn while wielding it. Any weapon ability that deals rolled damage using the Blade of a Thousand Years gains a +5 damage bonus, and any creature that takes damage from this weapon is frightened and weakened until the end of their next turn.\n\nRally the Righteous: The blade fills all around it with hope and courage. Each ally within 1 mile of the weapon gains an edge on weapon abilities and magic abilities, and has damage immunity 5. Additionally, each such creature's Stamina maximum increases by 15 and they gain a +15 bonus to Stamina when this ability first affects them.\n\nTurn the Tide: Each enemy minion within 1 mile of the sword is dazed. Any enemy leader or solo creature in that area takes a bane on ability rolls.\n\nVictory's Assurance: This weapon always appears on the eve before what will later come to be known as a historic battle. It disappears after 24 hours or when the battle is won, whichever comes first. By taking the blade, the wielder unwittingly enters into a pact with the weapon. If they don't secure victory against monumental odds or some great foe by the time the sword disappears, they are pulled into the sword, preventing any chance of resurrection, and forever dooming them to lend their strength to the heroes of other ages.\n\nSoul of the Martyr: If the wielder dies while holding this blade, their soul is drawn into the starlight hilt, where it remains for the rest of time before any chance of resurrection. The sword disappears, but the lingering feeling of hope that spreads from it remains. For the next hour, the effects of Rally the Righteous increase to provide a double edge on weapon abilities and magic abilities, damage immunity 10, an increase to Stamina maximum of 30, and a bonus to Stamina of +30.",

Any power roll made by the wielder that uses Presence automatically achieves a tier 3 outcome (the wielder can still roll to attempt a critical success or critical hit).\n\nChampion's Lasso: As a free maneuver, the wielder can trigger a glowing line of light that traces their path as they move, or can dismiss the glowing line. If the wielder crosses over this line, each creature and object of the wielder's choice enclosed inside the line and within 2 squares above and below it are considered lassoed by the Encepter. Creatures remain lassoed until the lasso is released or until a new line is drawn.\n\nDominion: Each creature lassoed by the Encepter is restrained and can't teleport. A creature caught in midair while lassoed stays in place rather than falling.\n\nObliteration: As a main action, the wielder raises the Encepter to the sky. Each target lassoed by the Encepter erupts in a prismatic burst of light, taking 10 psychic damage for each square horizontally encircled by the lasso. The lasso is then immediately released.\n\nAt World's End: If the Encepter was not taken from its cyclonic resting place with the purpose of vanquishing a terrible peril, then a terrible peril emerges to threaten the world within 3 days of the scepter being taken.",

The Mortal Coil taps into the entropic potential inherent in every living creature to cast a shadow capable of felling even gods. Only one destined for death can contain the power of the Mortal Coil. A mortal creature who carries this artifact serves as its host, gaining an additional action on each of their turns, aging at ten times the usual rate, and becoming unable to ever regain Stamina. A host with no natural maximum lifespan permanently reduces their Stamina maximum by 10 each year.\n\nWhen the Mortal Coil is left unattended or in the possession of a creature who is not mortal, it activates and can't be deactivated until a mortal creature becomes its host once more. While active, the artifact extends a penumbra of influence for 10 miles in every direction. Every creature in the penumbra is subject to the following effects.\n\nOne Foot in the Grave: Any creature in the penumbra has damage weakness 2 and can't regain Stamina.\n\nGet Busy Dyin': Each creature in the penumbra ages at 10 times the usual rate, and diseases and poisons affecting creatures in the penumbra run their course at 10 times their usual rate. A creature with no natural maximum lifespan permanently reduces their Stamina maximum by 10 each year. Each creature can undertake one additional respite activity during each respite.\n\nIf You Meet God on the Road, Kill Them: Every non‑mortal entity in the penumbra is granted the gift of mortality. Previously immortal or invulnerable entities—from planar creatures to the gods themselves—can be killed while in the penumbra, though not necessarily easily. Any creature or entity who dies in the Mortal Coil's penumbra experiences perfect death. They are permanently, irrevocably dead, and no magic, psionics, or technology can restore them to life.\n\nPerpetual Motion: If there are no creatures or entities within the Mortal Coil's penumbra, the radius of the penumbra doubles.\n\nBeneath Contempt: Deities and their servants always overlook the Mortal Coil and its host—either unable to notice it, or not considering it a threat. If the artifact is somehow destroyed or unmade through godly power, it consumes a year of life from every humanoid in the manifold where it was destroyed, then reforms in a hidden place.",
